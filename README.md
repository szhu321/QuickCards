# Quick Cards

## About

Quick Cards is a flash card app. The user can create, update, and delete flash cards and store them locally. I created this application to aid in learning new terminology. 

This project was created using Java8 and JavaFX. The JavaFX scene builder was used to layout the GUI.

### Features
- Adding, updating, and deleting flashcards.
- Flipping a flashcard with left mouse click on the card.
- Scrolling left and right through the cards with clickable buttons.
- Adding, updating, and deleting flashcard sets.
- Shuffling flash cards.
- Searching for a flash card.

## Installation

### Dependencies

- Java8
- JavaFX

### Setup

Clone/download the repository. Then using your favorite IDE open up the project (WARNING: make sure to open up the inner QuickCards directory). Make sure that both Java8 and JavaFX(should come with Java8) are included as dependencies(how this is done depends on the IDE).

- Run Game: Run src/main/MainRunner.java.
